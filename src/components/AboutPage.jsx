          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Founded in 2025, Tee Design Hub began with a simple mission: to provide high-quality, 
            custom t-shirts that help people express their unique personality and creativity.
          </p>
          <p>
            What started as a small passion project has grown into a thriving online platform 
            that connects designers, customers, and fashion enthusiasts from around the world.

          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            At Tee Design Hub, we believe that clothing is more than just fabricâ€”it's a canvas 
            for self-expression. Our mission is to help you create t-shirts that tell your story 
            and showcase your individuality.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're committed to sustainable practices, ethical manufacturing, and supporting 
            independent designers while providing a seamless, enjoyable shopping experience.

          <h2>Quality Commitment</h2>
          <p>
            Every t-shirt we produce is made from premium materials that are both comfortable 
            and durable. We use state-of-the-art printing technology to ensure vibrant, 
            long-lasting designs that withstand repeated washing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our attention to detail extends from the stitching to the packaging, because we 
            believe quality should never be compromised.
